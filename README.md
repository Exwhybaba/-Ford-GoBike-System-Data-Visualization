## by Oyelayo Seye


## Dataset

The dataset, 2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv, is downloaded from Ford GoBike and licensed by Ford GoBike. This dataset includes  183412 rows and 16 columns such duration_sec, start_time , end_time, start_station_id...
## Summary of Findings

While checking the trip distribution, it was discovered that the trip duration was rightly skewed. It was concentrated at the lower level, with most values below 2000 secs. As regards the distribution of gender, the male has the highest count, followed by the female. The subscriber has a greater number than the customer, about 8 times the customer.Â The distribution of age is concentrated around 20 to 40. Thursday is the most frequently used day. The most frequent start times are 8 a.m. in the morning and 5 p.m. in the evening.

Bivariate exploration: The customer has more duration seconds than the subscriber, and both distributions are less than 2500. The male subscribers are more than the female subscribers, and the male customers are more than female customers. As far as the mean is concerned, the female has a longer duration of seconds than the male and also, the customer used more seconds than the subscriber. Sunday and Saturday have the highest average seconds, while Monday is the second day with the highest average seconds, followed by Friday and Thursday, which are roughly equal in length. March has a duration of seconds longer than February as far as the mean is concerned. The age is below 80 years, with a high concentration between the ages of 20 and 45.

Multivariate exploration: There is no strong indication that one gender ride more than the other as the both gender can be seen around the same level. There is an unsurprising long tail when it comes to age. There is a relationship between customer days and subscriber days as the highest trip days fall on the same (Sunday and Saturday).

## Key Insights for Presentation

- We find that there is a large porportion of subscribers than the customers.The subscriber is about 8 times of the customer
- The male subscribers are more than the female subscribers and the male customers are more than female customers
- Most of the  age of the users is between 20 and 40
- Thursday and Tuesday has the most usage of the bikes
- most frequent usage hours are 8 o'clock in the monrning and 5 evening which relates to the regular working hours to most people
- The customers use the bikes for longer periods than subscribers, even though the subscribers are much higher in terms of numbers.
- By checking the two distributions, we can observe that the two have the lowest distribution, falling under 2500 secs, with the customers' own higher.
- Customers would use this on their non-working days as leisure, but especially at a longer time frame, as we have the highest duration of seconds for Saturday and Sunday.
- This clearly shows that subscribers and customers have very different lives and workstyles.
